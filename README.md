# How React works
React is a flexible , efficient , oen-source JavaScript library for building user interface(UI). It is a collection of a vanila javascript code wherether we use it to make website, application or desktop application User interface.Usually components created by pure javascript code & REACT convert it to HTML code for UI .Then this HTML code inject it by REACT DOM to html page & this process work it without loading full page.This is how react works


# Props Vs State 
#Props
Props can get initial value from parent Component.
Props can be changed by parent Component.
It Can set default values inside Component.
It Cannot change inside Component.
It can change in child Components.

# State

State can get initial value from parent Component.
State cannot be changed by parent Component.
It Can set default values inside Component.
It Can change inside Component.
It cannot change in child Components.

#UseState :
useState is a Hook that allows us to have state variables in functional components. Under the hood, React keeps track of these state variables and ensures they stay up-to-date on subsequent re-renders of the component.We can pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.
